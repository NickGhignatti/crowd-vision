## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Queries
Stop digging through complex tables. Just ask.
The AI understands context about your building's structure and can answer questions like:
* *"Which rooms are currently overcrowded?"*
* *"What is the average temperature in the Science Block?"*
* *"Is Room 101 safe for a class of 30 right now?"*

### 2. Intelligent Reasoning
Powered by advanced models, the system doesn't just read data—it reasons about it. It can suggest actions, such as recommending alternative rooms when one is full.

### 3. Automated Reporting
The AI runs in the background to detect anomalies that simple thresholds might miss, keeping your facility safe and efficient.
