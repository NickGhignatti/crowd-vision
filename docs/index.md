# Abstract 

Crowd-Vision is a web app simplifying the management of a structure through a 
digital twin, by monitoring (and showing) in real time the people inside it, thanks 
to several sensors.

The goal is to allow a better management and security of movements and study
through an interactive map and tools.

## Main features

- **Real time visualization** : thanks to websocket technology and sensors
- **Push server-initiated notification** : security issues or overcrowded areas
- **History and data logs** : sensor history and the possibility to plot them
- **LLM integration** : useful for both simple queries or dashboard reports

## Technical aspects
Build on top of **MEVN** stack
